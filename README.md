# Umbraco Properties Generator

Umbraco Properties Generator lets you create complex ui for marco by defining json properties for fast development

Start here:

1) Add plugin: copy folder App_Plugins\PropertiesGenerator to your own project App_Plugins folder

2) Add a json file in folder App_Plugins\PropertiesGenerator\properties\, look at the file "demo.json" for structure examples

3) Create a new macro with a new property that it's type is "Properties generator"
   and the alias of that property is the json file name

4) Use the macro :)
